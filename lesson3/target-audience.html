        <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
        <p>This website is for those expanding their businesses and bringing
            stuff from other countries.</p>
        <h2>PERSONAS</h2>
        <p>There are a big group of personas for this site. They are traders that bring the best quality of products
            from mainly China. The other
            personas seen here bring fruit, vegetables, and herbs.</p>
        <h2>SCENARIOS</h2>
        <p>It has been around five years since Chinese shopping malls started to operate here in Chile and they are well known
            for selling cheaper stuff. Locals can also start selling other products from China,
            such as clothes. Supermarkets are also bringing food from there. The farmer's market is also bringing food
            from Europe; finally, we have the people from Haiti who also sell their products here.</p>
